# RBS Prototype
Attempt at an oversimplified room booking system using JavaScript/HTML/CSS

## Things to note in general
Don't upload any of the READMEs as code. You'll find out why as you read but the TL;DR is that some of it includes "alternative solutions".  
If there's something you find yourself unable to do, it's alright to ask around, we're all learning and also likely confused.  
It is best if you write your code in a NEW .js file (eg making an index.js for your own code) then import it into the main page with <script src="index.js"></script>. This more of helps to minimise editing code that's already there and having a hard time reverting to it, if something messes up.  
There is no need to optimise any of your code. Pre-Optimisation can be bad most of the times and you can Google about it, but basically don't optimise for 0 customers. You can go for the least efficient, most wordy system ever if you want to, I won't judge.  
I do not mind if you wish to use a LLM to generate your code (eg ChatGPT or it's alternatives, I won't snitch). Though, use it at your own/the group's risk if you are unable to explain your own code to yourself or the group.  
If you are unable to find a way to make, for example, A.1.08 be ready for booking or able to be booked at 2pm Real Life time, don't worry. At most we'll just make the video presentation "look like it works at 1:30pm". funny editing :)  
There will likely be no database. Most of this will either be output into a text file or, well, funny editing part 2. Open to discussion.
