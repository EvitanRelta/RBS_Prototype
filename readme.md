# RBS Prototype
Attempt at an oversimplified room booking system using JavaScript/HTML/CSS

## Things to note in general
Don't upload any of the READMEs as code. You'll find out why as you read but the TL;DR is that some of it includes "alternative solutions".  
If there's something you find yourself unable to do, it's alright to ask around, we're all learning and also likely confused.  
Your local storage will most likely be empty on the first time you run the .html. Click on the Reset tables button once, then Refresh.  
If you are unable to find a way to make, for example, A.1.08 be ready for booking or able to be booked at 2pm Real Life time, don't worry. At most we'll just make the video presentation "look like it works at 1:30pm". funny editing :)  
If possible, minimise on global declarations. (eg var, const outside of any functions).
It is best if you write your code in a NEW .js file (eg making an index.js for your own code) then import it into the main page with <script src="index.js"></script>. This more of helps to minimise editing code that's already there and having a hard time reverting to it, if something messes up.  
There is no need to optimise any of your code. Pre-Optimisation can be bad most of the times and you can Google about it, but basically don't optimise for 0 customers. You can go for the least efficient, most wordy system ever if you want to, I won't judge.  
I do not mind if you wish to use a LLM to generate your code (eg ChatGPT or it's alternatives, I won't snitch). Though, use it at your own/the group's risk if you are unable to explain your own code to yourself or the group.  
If you can't code in a way to separate the pages into more than one date (i didn't add it due to time constraints), we can skip that for now and i can try to edit the code after merging.  
There are currently NO checks for format (eg starthour, endhour must be integer). Please take note of that in general testing, as it might break stuff. Use the debugs to reset stuff if necessary.  
Ignore soupClock.js for now, it's an old clock system I did and was wondering if I could add it into the top right of the page, but was afraid of wasting too much time on accessories and not the main course.  

## Useful links
w3schools.com has some pretty good, and free, practices, examples, tutorials. Honestly can be a lifesaver. Can be a major focus on CSS, Javascript. If you can't find what you're looking for from the library, it might be easier
to google "(thing you're looking for) w3schools". If it didn't exist there, too bad, you'll have to search elsewhere.

If you're starting out and learning how to code, Bro Code on YouTube is an interestingly good way to start off on almost any coding language. Mostly bite-sized video tutorials, it'll help to try and follow along over half a week or so. If not, he's still a good reference page for learning how to do some stuff.
