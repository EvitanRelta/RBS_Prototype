Coding HTML instruction for staff
1) I first set the title using <title> and name it UOW room booking system for staff

2) Then I entered the body which is welcome UOW staff

3) I keyed in the staff section by doing a section id and create a button with button onclick="create room()"

4) then I did the same thing for the room function table

5) I now do a dropdown box to display room details and use a </select> function to call it

6) Then I did all the buttons for room function for example to adjust the price " <button onclick="adjustPrice()">Adjust Price</button>"

7) Then I did the notification popup but using div id

8) Finally I linked it to the java script by using script src="name of javascript file"




Coding CSS instruction for Staff

1) I used a general style found on google which is arial, sans-seril as font and use a blue colour for background and white for words

2) Then I align the words using text-align function

3) as for the notification cause I want to do in on the top, I fixed the position and edit accordingly
